# gemocToyLanguage
an overly simple and small language realized interactively with the student @ Polytech'Nice in this course: http://www.i3s.unice.fr/~deantoni/teaching_resources/SI5/LanguageBehavioralSemanticsByPractice/current

the language comes with xtext syntax, sirius view and animation will debugging, an omniscient debugger and a state space explorer, all generated from the metalanguages used.

it is based on this version of the gemoc studio: https://ci.eclipse.org/gemoc/job/gemoc-studio-integration/job/FormalAnalysisByExhaustiveSimulation/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/
